Welcome to this repository! Here are some of my side projects regarding data science and machine learning. There are a few different sub-repositories, but I have tried to group them together by topic or give them insightful names.

Currently, I have uploaded projects related to working with databases in Python, machine learning, and even an application I developped to classify different varieties of flowers in PyTorch.
