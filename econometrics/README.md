It walks through how t-testing, simple differences, regression, and difference-in-differences techniques can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an economic program like [Progresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades). A more detailed introduction is given in the first part of the Notebook.
